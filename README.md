# C - Binary Trees

This repository hosts a collection of C programs dedicated to binary trees, meticulously crafted as part of a project at Holberton Coding School. Dive into the world of binary tree operations, covering creation, insertion, deletion, traversal, and more. Explore the intricacies of algorithms and data structures essential for mastering this fundamental aspect of computer science.

## Overview

Binary trees are hierarchical data structures widely used in computer science. They consist of nodes, each of which has at most two children: a left child and a right child. Binary trees are used for various applications such as sorting, searching, and representing hierarchical relationships.

## Contents

1. **Binary Tree Implementation**: Contains C programs implementing basic operations on binary trees, including creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal.
   
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Includes C programs implementing binary search trees, a specific type of binary tree where the left child of a node contains only nodes with values lesser than the node's value, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
